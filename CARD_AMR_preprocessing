#Resistance Gene Identifier to predict resistomes from metagenomic sequencing reads based on reference sequences in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistnace Database and read mapping algorithm
#Full documentation of CARD found here: https://github.com/arpcard/rgi

#All metagenomes were normalized to a paired read count of 500,000 using SeqTK (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) and sample below this read depth were removed from futher analyses
  seqtk sample -s100 read1.fq 250000 > sub1.fq
  seqtk sample -s100 read2.fq 250000 > sub2.fq

#Metagenomes were aligned to the cannonical CARD reference sequences using KMA
